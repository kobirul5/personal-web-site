                My name is <span className="font-semibold ">Kobirul Islam</span>. I completed my diploma in
                Pharmacy in 2023. However, I have always been passionate about computers. After completing my studies,
                I started a job in October 2023 at <span className="font-semibold ">Popular Diagnostic</span>
                and worked there until February 2024. Unfortunately, I didn&apos;t enjoy the job and realized it wasn&apos;t the
                right path for me.

                <br /><br />

                During this time, I discovered my interest in
                <span className="font-bold "> programming</span>,
                which gave me a sense of
                <span className="font-bold "> excitement</span> and
                <span className="font-bold "> fulfillment</span>.

                I decided to quit my job, return home, and fully focus on learning
                <span className="font-bold "> web development</span>.
                Since then, I have been
                <span className="font-bold "> pursuing MERN stack development</span>,
                and it has been an incredible journey of growth and learning.
