                My name is Kobirul Islam. I completed my diploma in Pharmacy in 2022. However, I have always been passionate about computers. After completing my studies, I started a job in October 2023 at Popular Diagnostic and worked there until February 2024. Unfortunately, I didn&apos;t enjoy the job and realized it wasn&apos;t the right path for me.During this time, I discovered my interest in programming, which gave me a sense of excitement and fulfillment. I decided to quit my job, return home, and fully focus on learning programming. Since then, I have been pursuing MERN stack web development, and it has been an incredible journey of growth and learning.</p>
